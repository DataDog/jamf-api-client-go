### Releasing

To prep a new release create a release branch in the format `release-{release number}` and push it to the remote. 

Once the branch is available create a feature branch off of the relase branch, this will allow us to group new functionality together for each release and `main` will always represent the latest official release.

When a release is ready to be pushed:
- Ensure all intended changes have been merged into the release branch and all tests are passing
- Merge the release branch into `main`
- Create a release on the releases page.
- Specify the version you want to release, following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec) principles.
  
  > If the tag isnâ€™t meant for production use, add a pre-release version after the version name. Some good pre-release versions might be v0.2-alpha or v5.9-beta.3

- Add release title containing the relase version if desired `ex v1.0.0-beta1 Initial Beta Release`
- Add sufficient changelog contents into the description of the release. (`git log` may be helpful)
- Create/Publish the release, which will automatically create a tag on the HEAD commit. (no binaries should be uploaded)

Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version **MUST NOT** be modified. Any modifications must be released as a new version.
